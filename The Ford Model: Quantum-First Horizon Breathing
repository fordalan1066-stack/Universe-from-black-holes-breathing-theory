The Ford Model: Quantum-First Horizon Breathing
Alan Ford – January 26, 2026 (Polished, constrained version)

Abstract
We present a minimal, quantum-first framework in which spacetime dynamics emerge from horizon microstructure. A three-patch horizon core, projected to a single-excitation qutrit, enforces an su(3) algebra without tuning. Entropy flux carried by null modes builds an invariant commutator stress Γ; when Γ exceeds a statistically derived threshold, inversion (“exhale”) triggers automatically, yielding a nonsingular bounce without exotic matter.
Particle masses arise as ripple-back ratios of Γ across algebraic folds, anchored at the third fold; cosmology follows from the same Γ-controlled stress balance. Deformations are symmetry-grouped and geometrically evolved, leaving no free functional choices. Explicit computation shows the uniform case fails to fit observed mass ratios, overconstraining the model by design.

These eight operators close exactly to su(3); matrices match the Gell-Mann basis up to an overall scale fixed by the minimal qutrit embedding. Higher-dimensional embeddings rescale all generators uniformly and are absorbed into the global constants

2. Stress and Symmetry-Constrained Deformations
Dynamics enter only through scalar deformations of fixed operators. By symmetry:
* All seam generators share one envelope
* Both Cartans share another

Γ(z)=[A<B∑ Tr([XA (z),XB (z)]†[XA (z),XB (z)])]1/2
This quantity is basis-independent and positive definite.
The deformation envelopes evolve geometrically. To leading order, algebraic coherence is damped by spacetime shear:

a(z)∝exp(−∫σ2(z)dz)
where 
σ

σ2 is the Raychaudhuri shear scalar. Other monotone functionals of 
σ

σ2 give equivalent qualitative behavior; the exponential is the minimal analytic closure.

3. Gate and Inversion
The inversion gate is

]
Ξ(z)=1+exp[(Γ⋆ −Γ(z))/ΔΓ]1
This arises as the logistic (error-function) approximation to threshold crossing under Gaussian horizon fluctuations. Non-Gaussian noise deforms 
Ξ
Ξ smoothly but preserves threshold behavior; the logistic is the universal central-limit fixed point.

6. Mass Ripple-Back
Masses encode memory of algebraic stress across folds. Anchoring at the third fold:

mμ =mτ Γ3 Γ2
m
e

me =mμ Γ2 Γ1
This assignment is explicitly falsifiable: incorrect fold identification or alternative mappings fail cross-channel constraints. Quarks and mixings are not addressed here.
For uniform deformation

,

Γ
1
≈
2.83
Γ3 ≈39.19,Γ2 ≈19.60,Γ1 ≈2.83
yielding:
* m μ  / m τ  ≈ 0.50   mμ /mτ ≈0.50
* m e  / m μ  ≈ 0.14   me /mμ ≈0.14
These disagree with observation. The mismatch forces shear-driven

a(z), which must simultaneously fit supernova

H(z) data—overconstraining the model.

7. Replication / Falsification Protocol
1. Construct operators and verify su(3) closure
2. Evolve a seam  , a Cartan    aseam ,aCartan  from shear
3. Compute Γ ( z ) , Ξ ( z ) , γ inv  ( z )   Γ(z),Ξ(z),γinv (z)
4. Fit one sector (masses or cosmology); predict the other without refit
5. Inconsistency falsifies the framework
